    "A1. Flask is a micro web framework for Python, which means it provides the tools and libraries to build web applications without imposing too many restrictions or dependencies on developers. It is classified as a micro-framework because it keeps the core simple but extensible, allowing developers to add the features they need through various Flask extensions.\n",

    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Lightweight and Minimal: Flask has a small core and does not require any particular tools or libraries, allowing developers to choose the components they want to use.\n",
    "2.Flexibility: Flask allows developers to make their own choices regarding how to structure their applications and what tools to use.\n",
    "3.Easy to Get Started: Flask's simplicity makes it easy for beginners to get started with web development in Python.\n",
    "4.Extensible: Developers can add various extensions to Flask, enhancing its functionality for specific requirements.\n",
    "5.Large Community: Flask has a large and active community, which means there is extensive documentation, tutorials, and third-party packages available.\n",
    "6.Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, making it easy to test and debug applications during development.\n",
